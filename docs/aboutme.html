<h1> ABOUT ME </h1>

<div class="about">
    <p>
        As a bioinformatics student with a passion for data science, I am constantly amazed by the complexity and intricacy of the human body. During my undergraduate studies,
        I was captivated by the way in which technology was revolutionizing the healthcare industry. It was during this time that I was introduced to bioinformatics by a professor of mine,
        and I knew immediately that this was the field I wanted to pursue. Since then, I have been fully immersed in the world of bioinformatics, constantly learning and developing my skills.
        My ultimate goal is to use my knowledge and expertise to make meaningful contributions to the health systems and research. I am passionate about using data to drive insights and improve patient outcomes.

        Whether it's working on large-scale genomics projects or developing cutting-edge algorithms to analyze medical data, I am always eager to take on new challenges and push myself to grow as a professional.
        I firmly believe that the intersection of biology and technology is where the future lies, and I am committed to being at the forefront of this exciting field.
        Overall, my unique blend of skills, passion, and drive make me an ideal candidate for any role in the bioinformatics industry. I am excited to continue exploring this fascinating field and making a real
        difference in the lives of patients around the world.
